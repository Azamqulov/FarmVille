                    This Cookie Policy explains how Zynga Inc. ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar
                    technologies to recognize you when you visit our website and use our FarmVille 3 mobile application
                    (collectively, the "Services"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well
                    as your rights to control our use of them.
                </p>

                <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
                    website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more
                    efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

                <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Zynga) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set
                    by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
                    third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
                    interactive content, and analytics).</p>

                <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
                <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
                    technical reasons in order for our Services to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or
                    "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
                    users to enhance the experience on our Services. Third parties serve cookies through our Services
                    for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>

                <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

                <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Services and
                    to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly
                    necessary to deliver the Services, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Services
                    function.</p>

                    preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and
                    in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>

                <h2>How Can You Control Cookies?</h2>
                <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie
                    preferences in the following ways:</p>

                <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
                <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. To find out more
                    about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them,
                    visit <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a> or <a
                        href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

                <h3>Cookie Consent Tool</h3>
                <p>When you first visit our website, you will be presented with a cookie banner that allows you to
                    accept or decline non-essential cookies.</p>

                <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
                <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have
                    your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are currently not set up
                    to respond to such signals.</p>

                <h2>Mobile Applications</h2>
                <p>Our mobile applications may use similar technologies to cookies, such as local storage, to collect
                    information about how you use our applications and provide features to you. You can disable local
                    storage on your mobile device through your device settings, but some features of our applications
                    may not function properly if you do so.</p>

                <h2>Updates to This Cookie Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the
                    cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this
                    Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>

                <p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
